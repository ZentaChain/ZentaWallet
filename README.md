## Zentawallet Android Mobile wallet.


##### Allows information to be stored or verified off-chain and on-chain ✔️

##### ERC20 & ERC721, ERC223 Supports and Dapps, inklusive ZentaSwap ✔️

##### ERC875 for non fungible tokens and simple atomic-swaps ✔️

##### ERC1386 - Managing issuers of cryptographic attestations ✔️

##### Client infrastructure ensures that keys are stored locally, on your device ✔️


#### Purpose ERC1386

This ERC provides an interface for attestation issuers to manage their attestation signing keys and the attestations that are issued off chain for actions such as revocation and validation.

In our draft implementation we include functions to hold cryptographic attestations, change the issuing contracts of attestations, revoke attestations and verify the authenticity of a cryptographic attestation.
 

#### Purpose ERC875

Transferring/Trading NFT's efficiently

While other standards allow the user to transfer a non-fungible token, they require one transaction per token, this is heavy on gas and partially responsible for clogging the ethereum network. There are also few definitions for how to do a simple atomic swap.
